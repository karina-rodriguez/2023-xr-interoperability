## Output
 

There are many different platforms for distributing XR experiences. 
Here is a list of the most popular ones.

- [Meta Quest](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/)
- [Valve Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)
- [VR YouTube](https://vr.youtube.com/)
- [Facebook 360](https://www.facebook.com/Facebook360/)

Note that they distribute content both through a web browser and 
through a device such as a phone or headset.

Beside these platforms, XR experiences can be installed as apps
on mobile phones through platforms such as Google and Apple apps:

- [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/)
- [Windows App Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/apps)
- [Google App Store](https://play.google.com/)

In most of these cases, the potential users is dependent on the
specific device they target.
