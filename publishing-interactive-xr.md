Challenge: Interoperability

What are the challenges for achieving  in Virtual Reality applications?


::::::: 

## VR Interoperability

- Users want the flexibility to access content across devices.
- Less hassle and expenses.
- For content creators and distributors, 
it means easier and more cost-effective production and distribution.
- More opportunities for ads and promotion.


## OpenXR

- Developed by Khronos consortium, developer of OpenGL and OpenGL ES.
- Open standard for access to XR (AR/VR) platforms and devices.
- Aim to solve AR/VR fragmentation.

## WebXR

The WebXR Device API allow developers to read information, such as
pose information from headset and controllers, and 
access hardware display 
capabilities commonly associated with Virtual Reality (VR) 
and Augmented Reality (AR) devices. 

It allows you develop and host VR and AR experiences on the web.

It allows to:

- Driven by the W3C group
- Manages the output/input of devices and controllers.
- Render the 3D scene to the chosen device at the appropriate frame rate.
- Allows for persistency (ability to keep persistent link to 3D worlds).
