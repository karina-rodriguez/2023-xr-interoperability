This tutorial will allow you 
to experience the implementation of 3D environments 
on web interfaces by using WebGL. 

WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API 
for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within 
any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins.
WebGL is fully integrated with other web standards, allowing 
GPU-accelerated usage of physics and image processing and 
effects as part of the web page canvas. It uses the HTML5 canvas element. 
You can use Three.JS (https://threejs.org/) or AFrame (https://aframe.io/) 
for your application, although we'll revise here the way to 
use Three.JS with Node.JS technology.

Introduction

In this tutorial, we will test all the infrastructure required to implement 3D environments, including support for Virtual Reality (VR), on the web. It is meant to help you implement an example from THREE.JS.


Exercise 1. Create a website

Using https://brighton.domains/ create a folder on a subdomain, such as vrtest.yourname.brighton.domains. Through this, you will be able to test your own VR example, such as mine: https://vrtest.kre.brighton.domains


For this, you will need to:

1. Create a subdomain, which will allow you to specify a folder where you can upload your HTML files

Exercise 2. Download a BoilerPlate Three.JS implementation using Node.JS


It is best to start using an existing boiler plate code which has been configured for Node.JS to understand how it works and modify according to your needs, for example:

GitHub - Sean-Bradley/Threejs-Boilerplate: A Threejs Boilerplate to aid in quick prototyping
A Threejs Boilerplate to aid in quick prototyping. Contribute to Sean-Bradley/Threejs-Boilerplate development by creating an account on GitHub.
GitHub

So, create folder in Visual Studio Code and checkout from the github repository.

Once you download the code, you can use npm to install and start:



$ cd Threejs-Boilerplate

$ npm install

$ npm start

This will run the Node.JS application and you can see the site by opening your browser and going to: http://127.0.0.1:3000

You should see the default example:

Exercise 3. Modify your code to run a VR example

Using the VR examples in Three.JS: https://threejs.org/examples/ find a VR example which you want to work with, such as:

https://threejs.org/examples/?q=vr#webxr_vr_cubes and look at the code: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webxr_vr_cubes.html

You can copy the code within the <script> tag and include it in your client.js file. When running the example using $npm start you should see the new example running:


Exercise 4. Examine the code

Examine the code and make any modification you want to implement before deploying on the server. This can include changing the type of geometry, the number or the material you use:



``` javascript

  const geometry  =  new   THREE . BoxGeometry (  0.15 ,  0.15 ,  0.15  );


  for  (  let   i  =  0 ;  i  <  200 ;  i  ++ ) {


  const   object  =  new   THREE . Mesh (  geometry ,  new   THREE . MeshLambertMaterial ( {  color :   Math . random () *  0xffffff  } ) );


```




Excercise 5. Upload your code to the webserver

To deploy your code, you will need to copy/paste your code to the brighton.domains server. For this, you can use scp on the command line so that the content is copied recursively.




Now, in the brighton.domains dashboard look for the Node.JS functionality and create a new application with the content  on the folder.



 

After the application starts, you should be able to test it using a cardboard VR or headset through the http address.
