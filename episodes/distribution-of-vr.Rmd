## Types of content in XR experiences / applications


Distinction is made between environments which incorporate different type of content,
in particular:

- Vectorised-3D environments, as in an interactive virtual environment 
- Image-renderings, as in 360 images


### Vectorised-3D environment
These experiences are usually developed within a vector-formatted 3D environment,
such as the full 3D scene (inc. objects in the scene),
as well as the camera, and lighting information.

It allows for a more immersive experience if a user can fully interact
with this visually-rich environment.

It also allows for interactivity as the environment reacts
to the users' actions. 

Resolution of the image usually depends on the rendering mechanism of
such environments.

### Immersive image-renders
These environments are developed using 360 panoramas which record
an environment from a central position with a view in every direction.

Users can rotate the camera view to select the direction to look at. Yet
they cannot move within the environnment.

These experiences can be easier/cheaper to produce an distribute as they only
require a rendered photograph or video to be displayed.

However, allowing for high-quality imagery or interactivity might incurr
in a longer/more expensive development cycle. But also for an enhanced
user experience.

For high-quality resolution, cameras such as the [Insta360 Pro2](https://onlinemanual.insta360.com/pro2/en-us/basic/prepare/about), will produce an image of 7680 x 7680 (8K) pixles, and video of 7680 x 3840 pixels. These cameras can also support stereoscopic images.

## Stereoscopic versus No-Stereoscopic Content
Despite the modality of Distribution, content can be acessed via stereoscopic or non-stereoscopic mode.

If the experience can be accessed in stereoscopic mode, then adequate hardware,
such as a VR headset or stereoscopic glasses, willl be required by the user.
This will impose additional requirements for the user in terms of hardware, and its
capabilities to acess content.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- XR experiences can involve 3D environments or 360 images
- Distribution will depend on the modality, as well as whether the content is stereoscopic or not
- The hardware that is available to users will depend on the type of content
