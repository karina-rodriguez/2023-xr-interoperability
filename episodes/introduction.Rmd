## Introduction


This lecture covers topics related to the distribution of XR experiences or applications.

It particularly focus on the availability of these experiences through various platforms and devices.

It considers the types of platforms that are available in the domain.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: What is an XR experience?

Explore which of the following could be consider an XR experience?

Decide why this is the case?

Reflect how will you make available such experience to a user?


- 360 panoramas/video
- Interactive larger-scale images
- Outdoor 360 audio recording 
- Immersive 3D-world
- Interactive 3D model


:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Output
 
All of these examples could be considered an XR experience.
Although all have different levels of interactivity, sensory
input
as well as user-freedoms for moving within the environment.

## Figures

You can include figures generated from R Markdown:

```{r pyramid, fig.alt = "pie chart illusion of a pyramid", fig.cap = "Sun arise each and every morning"}
pie(
  c(Sky = 78, "Sunny side of pyramid" = 17, "Shady side of pyramid" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("deepskyblue", "yellow", "yellow3"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```
Or you can use pandoc markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
